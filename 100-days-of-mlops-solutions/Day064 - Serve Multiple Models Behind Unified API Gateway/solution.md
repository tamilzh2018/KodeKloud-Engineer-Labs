# Task
The xFusionCorp Industries ML platform team operates three models for fraud detection and customer management, accessible via a single Nginx reverse proxy on port 8085: /fraud/, /churn/, and /recommend/, each routing to its respective Flask container. The fraud and churn services are already integrated in the docker-compose.yml and nginx.conf files. The directory for the recommend service, which contains a functioning application and Dockerfile, is available on disk. Your task is to integrate the recommend service into the docker-compose.yml, add the corresponding upstream and location block to the Nginx configuration, launch the stack, and verify that all routes respond appropriately.


The Docker daemon is already running. Base images (python:3.11-slim, nginx:alpine) are being pulled in the background at startup, so the first docker compose up -d returns in seconds.

The project layout under /root/code/serving/multi-model/:

fraud/app.py + fraud/Dockerfile – Flask service returning {"service": "fraud", "is_fraud": ...}. Correct.
churn/app.py + churn/Dockerfile – Flask service returning {"service": "churn", "churn_risk": ...}. Correct.
recommend/app.py + recommend/Dockerfile – Flask service returning {"service": "recommend", "items": [...]}. Correct — but not yet referenced by compose or nginx.
docker-compose.yml – Declares fraud, churn, and nginx services. The recommend service block is missing.
nginx.conf – Routes /fraud/ and /churn/ to their container upstreams. The recommend upstream + location block is missing.
The end state must include:

docker-compose.yml declares a recommend service that builds from ./recommend and carries container_name: mm-recommend.
nginx.conf declares a recommend upstream (server recommend:5000;) and a location /recommend/ block that proxies to it.
docker compose ps reports all four containers (mm-fraud, mm-churn, mm-recommend, mm-nginx) as Up.
curl -X POST http://localhost:8085/fraud/predict -d '{...}' returns a JSON body with "service": "fraud".
curl -X POST http://localhost:8085/churn/predict -d '{...}' returns a JSON body with "service": "churn".
curl -X POST http://localhost:8085/recommend/predict -d '{...}' returns a JSON body with "service": "recommend" and a non-empty items array.
Model the new entries on the existing fraud and churn blocks—same structure, same naming convention. After editing both files, docker compose up -d reads the new compose entry and builds the recommend image; nginx mounts the updated config from the host filesystem at container start.

# Solution

A real platform serves many models, and clients shouldn't need to know where each one lives. A single API gateway fronts them: one public address that routes each request by URL prefix to the right model's container. This task wires a third model service into an nginx reverse-proxy fabric that already fronts two — adding its compose service and the nginx `upstream` + `location` block — then confirms each prefix reaches its own model.

> As an MLOps engineer, you put a gateway in front of multiple models so routing, addressing, and cross-cutting concerns live in one place — you are not comparing the models. The models and data are synthetic.

#### Follow the steps below

##### 1. Confirm the starting state.
From a VS Code terminal:
```
cd /root/code/serving/multi-model
ls
ls recommend/
cat docker-compose.yml
cat nginx.conf
```
All three service directories (`fraud/`, `churn/`, `recommend/`) exist with working `app.py` + `Dockerfile`. `docker-compose.yml` declares only `fraud`, `churn`, and `nginx`. `nginx.conf` routes only `/fraud/` and `/churn/`.

##### 2. Add the `recommend` service to `docker-compose.yml`.
Open `/root/code/serving/multi-model/docker-compose.yml` in the VS Code editor. Insert the `recommend` block next to the existing `churn` block, and add `recommend` to nginx's `depends_on`:
```yaml
services:
  fraud:
    build: ./fraud
    container_name: mm-fraud

  churn:
    build: ./churn
    container_name: mm-churn

  recommend:
    build: ./recommend
    container_name: mm-recommend

  nginx:
    image: nginx:alpine
    container_name: mm-nginx
    ports:
      - "8085:80"
    volumes:
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro
    depends_on:
      - fraud
      - churn
      - recommend
```
Save.

##### 3. Add the `recommend` upstream + location to `nginx.conf`.
Open `/root/code/serving/multi-model/nginx.conf` and add the upstream alongside the existing ones, plus a matching `/recommend/` location:
```nginx
events {}

http {
    upstream fraud_backend {
        server fraud:5000;
    }

    upstream churn_backend {
        server churn:5000;
    }

    upstream recommend_backend {
        server recommend:5000;
    }

    server {
        listen 80;

        location /fraud/ {
            proxy_pass http://fraud_backend/;
        }

        location /churn/ {
            proxy_pass http://churn_backend/;
        }

        location /recommend/ {
            proxy_pass http://recommend_backend/;
        }
    }
}
```
Save.

##### 4. Bring the stack up.
```
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps
```
All four containers (`mm-fraud`, `mm-churn`, `mm-recommend`, `mm-nginx`) report `Up`. The first boot builds the `recommend` image (python:3.11-slim is already cached, so only Flask installs).

##### 5. Verify every route answers.
```
curl -s -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"amount":3200,"hour":23,"num_tx_past_day":5}' \
  http://localhost:8085/fraud/predict

curl -s -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"tenure_days":30,"support_tickets":7}' \
  http://localhost:8085/churn/predict

curl -s -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"user_id":42}' \
  http://localhost:8085/recommend/predict
```
The three calls return JSON bodies with `"service": "fraud"`, `"service": "churn"`, and `"service": "recommend"` respectively — proof that nginx is routing each prefix to the right container.
